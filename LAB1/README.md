# LAB1 – Dataset Generation and Cat Breed Classification (CSET419)

## Introduction
This lab is part of the course **Generative Artificial Intelligence (CSET419)**.  
The objective of this lab is to generate a dataset using a generative model and then use this dataset for cat breed classification using deep learning techniques.

## Experiment 1: Dataset Creation using Diffusion Model

### File
LAB1GENAI(Dataset_Creation_of_different_cat_species_using_diffusion_model).ipynb

### Description
In this experiment, a diffusion-based generative model is used to generate images of different cat species. The generated images are saved in separate folders according to their class labels. This dataset is later used for training classification models.

### Outcome
A structured image dataset containing different cat species is created for further experiments.

## Experiment 2: Cat Breed Classification

### File
LAB1GENAI(Cat_Breed_Classification).ipynb

### Description
This experiment focuses on classifying cat breeds using the generated dataset. Different deep learning approaches are implemented and compared to study their performance on limited data.

### Models Used
- Custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- Pre-trained ResNet-50 model

### Learning Approaches
- Supervised learning
- Few-shot learning
- Zero-shot learning
- Continual learning

### Evaluation
Model performance is evaluated using classification accuracy, and a comparison is made between the custom CNN and the pre-trained ResNet-50 model.
