Variational Autoencoder (VAE) on MNIST & Fashion-MNIST
  This repository presents an implementation of a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) using PyTorch, trained on the MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets.
  The project focuses on representation learning, image reconstruction, generative sampling, and latent space analysis.
Project Overview
  A Variational Autoencoder is a generative deep learning model that learns a probabilistic latent space instead of fixed encodings.
  By sampling from this latent space, the model can generate new and diverse images.
  This project was developed as part of a Generative AI laboratory assignment.
